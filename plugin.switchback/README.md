Switchback
===================================

`plugin.switchback`

[!["Buy Me A Coffee"](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bossanova808)

Kodi utility for fast switching between recently played media.

Available from the Kodi official repository (i.e. don't install from here - just go to Add-ons -> Get Add-ons -> Video -> Switchback)

Keeps a list of recently played media - supports Kodi library episodes, movies, PVR channels, songs and non-library files.  Does not (yet?) support add-ons or PVR recordings.

The primary intended use is to make for super easy Switchback between two in progress video.  Bind a remote/keyboard key to Switchback, e.g.:

`<z mod="ctrl">PlayMedia(plugin://plugin.switchback/?mode=switchback,resume)</z>`

Consider this scenario:

- You are watching 'video A' with your partner.  You are interrupted and your partner needs to tend to the kids/howl at the moon.
- You navigate to 'video B' and watch some of that.
- Your partner comes back.
- You hit your one button 'Switchback' and 'video A' starts playing again, no need for tedious navigation etc.
- You are interrupted again - the moon is so very bright tonight - hit your 'Switchback' to resume 'video B' immediately, again with one magic button and no tedious navigation.
